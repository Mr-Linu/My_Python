1. DataFrame
    A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain
    value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.

2. Series
    A Series, by contrast, is a sequence of data values. If a DataFrame is a table, a Series is
    a list. And in fact you can create one with nothing more than a list

3. Indexing
    iloc[r,c] - takes numbers and number lists as values
    loc[] - takes numbers and number list and text list as values. this include the ending delimiter

# setting index to a desire value we use the .set_index("values")
